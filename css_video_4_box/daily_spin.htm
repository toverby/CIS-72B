        <h3>Coffee Observations</h3>
        <p>The surrounding air was filled with the aroma of freshly ground Arabica coffee and the rythmic beats  of one Bob Marley. Despite this, I couldn't shake the cobwebs of unfocused thought. Something needed to be done. I rubbed my eyes (as if that would help) and glanced down at my &quot;tall&quot; (small) cup of caffe verona.</p>
		  <div class="pullquote">And then all of a sudden it hit me...</div>
		<p>The swirls of half and half were still slowly encircling the cup from its last stir. It reminded me of something circling a drain just before it vanishes from sight forever. And then all of a sudden it hit me -- what I needed to do was dump my existing lifestyle down the drain and start heading in a new direction! Addition by subtraction -- subtract a negative and get a postive result! </p>
        <div class="pullquote">Then I got a little more daring...</div>
		<p>Right then I started listing things that I needed to dump from my life in order to move myself forward. It was amazing how that list grew. First I started safely -- that fake friendship with that annoying guy I used to know in high school. Then I got a little more daring. By the time I had finished my cup of coffee I had committed to donating half of my wardrobe, moving out of my apartment, and quitting my job! It is amazing what a good cup of coffee can do for your soul. </p>
