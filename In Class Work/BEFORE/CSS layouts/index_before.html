		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>If you haven't guessed, we are all about designing Web pages with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). In particular, we feature state of the art designs and layouts using CSS and XHTML standard compliant code. By doing so,  we obtain precise layout positioning without use of tables and the convoluted code associated with them. As a result, our Web sites are easier to build, easier to modify, and much easier to maintain for larger sites. This is due to the fact that the layout specifications reside in the separate style sheets instead of imbedded within each of the pages. </p>
		<p>Our approach is highly recommended by the W3C due to its standards compliant nature. The business world is also clammering for these techniques because of the proven cost-effectiveness of the approach. This has been born out in studies as well as in real world applications. </p>

		<h2>Why Dreamweaver? </h2>
		<p>We use and promote the use of Dreamweaver because it is one of the best overall tools for constructing and maintaining Web sites. Although there are an abundance of tools available for various specific tasks, Dreamweaver is the one standout application that handles the entire Web site construction and maintanance process from start to finish by integrating tools for XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, image editing (using and automating Fireworks), and server side scripting in a variety of languages. As such, it has become an industry standard tool. </p>
		<p>For those just learning Web page creation, you can get up to speed quickly and begin creating your own basic site. For the complications involved in a full-service site however, expertise is needed and that is where we come in!</p>
