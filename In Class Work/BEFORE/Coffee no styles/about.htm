			<h2>About Us</h2>
         <p>Here at &quot;The Full Cup&quot;, we've embraced the coffee culture. People come for the coffee, but they stay for the vibe. The atmosphere here at the Full Cup includes background music, entertainment, Internet access, games, artwork, and much more.</p>
			<h3>History of The Full Cup</h3> 
			<p>The Full Cup of Coffee began in 1987 as a simple &quot;coffee to go&quot; shop, catering to business patrons on the go. Although we still service some of those very same business types, our shops have a much more relaxed, community feel to them. We have evolved, changed with the times. And we are thriving!  Come check us out.</p>
			<h3>Today's Full Cup</h3>
			<p>Today it not unusual to look out over our tables and see a group of college students studying in one corner, several people banging away on their laptops, a few people playing chess at one table, a business meeting over there, and a few others relaxing over a newspaper elsewhere.</p>
			<h3>The Coffee</h3>
         <p>Ahh, the coffee. The Full Cup is known throughout the community as brewing up some of the finest coffees available. Although the aroma alone speaks volumes, you can taste the difference in one quick sip. Like we said, you'll come in for the coffee, but you'll stay for the vibe!</p>
