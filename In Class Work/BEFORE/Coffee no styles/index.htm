	<h2>Home</h2>
	<p>Welcome to the &quot;Full Cup of Coffee&quot;, affectionately referred to as the &quot;Full Cup&quot; by our regulars. And there are quite a few &quot;regulars&quot;. If you have not already had the pleasure, we invite you to stop in and try a cup of your favorite coffee, check out the scene, and who knows, maybe you'll become a regular too. </p>
	<h3>The Atmosphere</h3>
	<p>Here at &quot;The Full Cup&quot;, we've embraced the coffee culture. People come for the coffee, but they stay for the vibe. The atmosphere here at the Full Cup includes background music, live music, poetry readings, book readings, Internet access, board games, card games, electronic games, local artwork,  a community feel, comfortable furniture, and much more.</p>
	<h3>The Coffee</h3>
	<p>Ahh, the coffee. The Full Cup is known throughout the community as brewing up some of the finest coffees available. Although the aroma alone speaks volumes, you can taste the difference in one quick sip. For more information about our coffee, check out our <a href="coffees.htm">coffees page</a>and its mini-guide. </p>
