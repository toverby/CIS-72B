<h2>Coffees</h2>
<p>All of our coffees can be purchased by the pound in either whole bean or ground form. If you don't see your favorite already ground in our store, we can grind it fresh for you while you wait. In our stores we always have 3 coffees of the day brewed fresh and on hand -- one which is full strength and bold, one  which is  flavored and mild, and one of which is decaf.</p>
<h3>Mini Guide</h3>

<h3>Variety</h3>
<p>In addition to these coffees, we also offer  a variety of flavored coffees as well as many decaf coffees. All of our coffees can be served hot, over ice, or blended. A variety of syrups, creamers and sweeteners are also available. Just let our server know how you like it and they'll be glad to serve it that way. And if there is something you were hoping to find but didn't, please let us know. Maybe we can order for you for next time. And we are always looking for new items to add to our menu. Your input and feedback are always welcome. </p>
