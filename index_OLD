						Intro to CSS
						Due Tuesday Apr 28 In class
						7 Printouts, 100 Points

						Be sure to read the "Assignment #0" handout before beginning any work on this assignment. Note that if for some reason you do not have the textbook yet you can actually do the entire assignment without it. But note that this will NOT be the case in the next assignments so this was designed to allow you a week's time to obtain the book.

						Be aware that our textbook (like any book) does have a few errors. Fortunately, ours also has an "errata" page, where known errors are corrected and updated over time. For the most recent version, refer to this link to avoid problems in your work: http://oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920024996
						Part 1: HTML for CSS (Chapter 1 Questions)
						1 Printout, 15 Points

						Before you can begin to write CSS to format your Web page content, you have to be able to write and understand the HTML that structures your Web page content. Although you probably already know at least some HTML, this chapter stresses the proper HTML approach that will set you up for successful CSS.

						If you have the textbook, browse the "introduction" on pages 1-16, paying particular attention to any sections you are not familiar with. There may be some useful information in there. But there are no questions on this material so you can feel free to skip it if you are already familiar with it or don't have time. After this introduction comes chapter 1.

						Read Chapter 1 pages 17-34 in your textbook, entitled "HTML for CSS". Then answer the questions below according to the directions that appear below the questions.

						If you do not yet have the textbook, you may read a PDF version of chapter one by clicking on the link below:

						After reading this material in your textbook or from the PDF file above, carefully answer the questions below.

						    What are the proper roles for HTML and CSS to play in the making of Web pages today?
						        HTML should provide the look of your Web site and CSS should provide the structure and meaning of the site's content.
						        HTML provides the display of the pages' images and layout, CSS provides the display of the text.
						        HTML provides the structure for the site's content and CSS provides the formatting of the content.
						        HTML played the role of writing Web page content in the past, but now it is the role of CSS.
						    In figure 1-3 on page 25, the banner (top) area was most likely created by using either a surrounding "div" tag or a surrounding "header" tag.
						        True
						        False
						    When deciding between using an "h2" tag or an "h3" tag for a heading, the decision should be based on...
						        how many other headings are above this one.
						        how many other headings are below this one.
						        what role the heading plays relative to other text on the page
						        how big you want this text to be displayed on the page
						    A "span" tag differs from a "div" tag in that...
						        CSS can be used to format a "div" tag but not to format a "span" tag
						        A "span" tag is new in HTML5 whereas a "div" tag has been used in earlier versions of HTML
						        A "div" tag will create a visible border around itself in the browser but a "span" tag will not
						        "Div" tags can be used to surround blocks of page content but "span" tags cannot.
						    Where should a "doctype" statement be placed?
						        Anywhere within the HTML file.
						        At the top of the HTML file.
						        At the bottom of the HTML file.
						        Anywhere within the CSS file.
						        At the top of the CSS file.

						Printout:

						    Print the above questions and answers without all the surrounding stuff. To do so, from within your browser (such as Firefox), use your mouse to select the above questions and answers. Then using your browser's File menu, choose "Print..." and then choose the "selection" option in the resulting print dialog box to print just that part of this long Web page.

						    After it prints, circle all the correct answers (or just their letters) to all the questions.

						    Write your name at the top of the page. This is what you will turn in.
