FONTLOG for the KePT Sans fonts
===============================

This file provides detailed information on the KePT Sans Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the KePT Sans fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------

KePT Sans is balkan enhancement of PT Sans. 

PT Sans is a type family of universal use. It consists of 8 styles: 
regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard 
computer font family; two narrow styles (regular and bold) are intended 
for documents that require tight set; two caption styles (regular and bold) 
are for texts of small point sizes. The design combines traditional 
conservative appearance with modern trends of humanistic sans serif and 
characterized by enhanced legibility. These features beside conventional 
use in business applications and printed stuff made the fonts quite useable 
for direction and guide signs, schemes, screens of information kiosks and 
other objects of urban visual communications.

The fonts next to standard Latin and Cyrillic character sets contain 
signs of title languages of the national republics of Russian Federation 
and support the most of the languages of neighboring countries. The fonts 
were developed and released by ParaType in 2009 with financial support 
from Federal Agency of Print and Mass Communications of Russian Federation 
as a second part of the project «Public Type of Russian Federation». 
Design - Alexandra Korolkova with assistance of Olga Umpeleva and supervision 
of Vladimir Yefimov.
